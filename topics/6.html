			<li>indirect speech</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<h2 id="iii">>📗Direct speech</h2>
		<p>Direct speech repeats, or quotes, the exact words spoken. When we use direct speech in writing, we place the
			words spoken between quotation marks (" ") and there is no change in these words.</p>

				<td>Example:</td>
				<td>She says, "What time will you be home?"</td>

		<h2>>📕 Indirect speech</h2>

		<p>Reported or indirect speech is usually used to talk about the past, so we normally change the tense of the
			words spoken. We use reporting verbs like 'say', 'tell', 'ask', and we may use the word 'that' to introduce
			the reported words.</p>

			<tr>
				<td>Example:</td>
				<td>She was speaking on the telephone.</td>
			</tr>

		<h2 id="iv">>📗Tense changes when using reported speech</h2>
		<p>
			Normally, the tense in reported speech is one tense back in time from the tense in direct speech:
		</p>
		<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
			<tr>
				<td>Example:</td>
				<td>"I always drink coffee", she said --> She said that she always drank coffee.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Example:</td>
				<td>"Bill arrived on Saturday", he said. --> He said that Bill had arrived on Saturday.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Example:</td>
				<td>"I am reading a book", he explained. --> He explained that he was reading a book</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Example:</td>
				<td>"I have been to Spain", he told me. --> He told me that he had been to Spain.</td>

			</tr>

		</table>
		<h2 id="v">>📘Changing time and place references when reporting speech</h2>
		<p>
			Time and place must often change when going from direct to reported speech.
		</p>
		<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
			<tr>
				<td>Example:</td>
				<td>""I saw him today", she said. --> She said that she had seen him that day.</td>

				<td>"I'll see you tomorrow", he said --> He said that he would see me the next day.</td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<h2 id="vi">>📗Question forms and reporting speech</h2>
		<p>
		<h3>Word order:</h3>
		Normal word order is used in reported questions, that is, the subject comes before the verb, and it is not
		necessary to use 'do' or 'did'.
		</p>
		<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
			<tr>
				<td>Example: (direct to indirect)</td>
				<td>"Where does Peter live?" --> She asked him where Peter lived.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Example: (direct to indirect)</td>
				<td>"Where are you going?" --> She asked where I was going.</td>
		</table>
		<h3>Yes / no questions</h3>

		<p> type of question is reported by using 'ask' + 'if / whether' + clause:</p>
		<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
			<tr>
				<td>Example: (direct to indirect)</td>
				<td>"Do you speak English?" --> He asked me if I spoke English.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Example: (direct to indirect)</td>
				<td>"Are you British or American?"--> He asked me whether I was British or American.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>
					example: (direct to indirect)
				</td>
				<td>"Is it raining?" --> She asked if it was raining.</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<h3>Question words:</h3>
		<p>
			This type of question is reported by using 'ask' (or another verb like 'ask') + question word + clause. The
			clause contains the question, in normal word order and with the necessary tense change.
		</p>
		<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
			<tr>
				<td>Example: (direct to indirect)</td>
				<td>"What is your name?" he asked me. --> He asked me what my name was.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Example: (direct to indirect)</td>
				<td>"How old is your mother?", he asked. --> He asked how old her mother was.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Example: (direct to indirect)</td>
				<td>"Why did you leave?", she asked. --> She asked why I had left.</td>
			</tr>

		</table>

		<h2 id="vii">>📘Reporting verbs</h2>
		<p>
			Reporting verbs are used to report what someone said or did. They are followed by the person who said or
			did it, and then the clause that contains the reported speech.Some reporting verbs may appear in more than
			one of the following groups because they can be used in several ways.
		</p>
		<h3>Verbs followed by "if" or "whether":</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>ask</li>
			<li>know</li>
			<li>remember</li>
			<li>say</li>
			<li>see</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Common Verbs followed by a "that":</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>add</li>
			<li>doubt</li>
			<li>reply</li>
			<li>admit</li>
			<li>estimate</li>
			<li>report</li>
			<li>agree</li>
			<li>explain</li>
			<li>reveal</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 id="viii">>📘Reporting orders, requests, and suggestions</h2>
		<p>When we want to report an order or request, we can use a verb like 'tell' with a to-clause: He told me to go
			away. The pattern is verb + indirect object + to-clause. The indirect object is the person spoken to. Other
			verbs used to report orders and requests in this way are: command, order, warn, ask, advise, invite, beg,
			teach, & forbid.</p>

			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example: (direct to indirect)</td> 
					<td>The doctor said to me, "Stop smoking!". --> The doctor told me to stop smoking.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Example: (direct to indirect)</td>
					<td>"Get out of the car!" said the policeman. --> The policeman ordered him to get out of the car.</td>
