	<h2 id="i">>📗Verb Tenses</h2>
		<img src="../images/verbt.png" width="500px" height="300px" alt="image is either coruptted or missing"> 
			<p>Verbs come in three tenses: past, present, and future. The past is used to describe things that have already happened (e.g., earlier in the day,
				yesterday, last week, three years ago). The present tense is used to describe things that are happening right now, or things that are continuous.
			    The future tense describes things that have yet to happen (e.g., later, tomorrow, next week, next year, three years from now).
			</p>
	<br>
	<h3 id="ii">>📘Simple Present Tense</h3>
		<p>The simple present is a verb tense with two main uses. We use the simple present tense when an action is happening right now, or when it happens 
		regularly (or unceasingly, which is why it’s sometimes called present indefinite). Depending on the person, the simple present tense is formed by using
		the root form or by adding –s or –es to the end.
		</p>
		<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
			<tr>
				<td>Example:</td>
				<td>I feel great!</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td></td>
				<td>Pauline loves pie.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td></td>
				<td>I’m sorry to hear that you’re sick.</td>
			</tr>
			
	
		</table>
	<p>The other is to talk about habitual actions or occurrences.:</p>
	<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
		<tr>
			<td>Example:</td>
			<td>Pauline practices the piano every day.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td></td>
			<td>Ms. Jackson travels during the summer.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td></td>
			<td>Hamsters run all night.</td>
		</tr>

	</table>
	<p>Typically, when we want to describe a temporary action that is currently in progress, we use the present 
		continuous: Pauline can’t come to the phone right now because she is brushing her teeth.
	</p>
	<br>

		
	<br>
	<h3 id="iii">>📕Present Perfect Tense</h3>
		<p>The present perfect tense is one of the common verb tenses in English, used to show an action that happened in
			the past that is directly related to the present, such as actions that are still continuing or that indicate a 
			change over time. We cover a complete list of when to use the present perfect tense below. 
		</p>
			
	<br>
	<h4 id="iv">>📔How do you use present perfect tense?</h4>
		<p>
			In the present perfect tense, the main verbs always use the auxiliary verbs (helper verbs) has or have. The 
			main verb takes a participle form, specifically the past participle. The past participle is often the same form as the simple
			past form of the verb, unless it’s an irregular verb, which each have their own unique past participle form. We explain in more 
			detail how to form them in our guide to participles.
		</p>
		<p>
			Only the auxiliary verbs are conjugated to fit the subject-verb agreement in the present perfect tense; the past participle of 
			the main verb remains the same no matter what the subject is. Generally, you use have for all subjects except the singular
			third-person, which instead uses has. 
		</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>First-person:</td>
					<td>I have come a long way.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Second-person:</td>
					<td>You have come a long way.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Third-person plural:</td>
					<td>They have come a long way.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Third-person singular:</td>
					<td>He/she/it has come a long way.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		<p>
			The present perfect tense has specific constructions for standard statements, negatives, and questions, explained below.
			We also discuss how to use the present perfect tense with adverbs and with the passive voice. 
		</p>
	<br>
	
		<h3 id="v">>📔Present Continuous</h3>
			<p>
				The present continuous verb tense indicates that an action or condition is happening now, frequently, and may continue into the future.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Present Continuous Formula: to be [am, is, are] + verb [present participle]
			</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>Aunt Christine is warming up the car while Scott is looking for his new leather coat. They are eating at Scott’s favorite restaurant today, Polly’s Pancake Diner.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Key words: <b>Verb, present participle, tense, dynamic verbs, stative verbs</b></p>
			<p>
				The present continuous (present progressive) tense is a way to convey any action or condition that is happening right now, frequently, and may be ongoing. It adds energy and action to writing, and its effect helps readers understand when the action is happening. Imagine Aunt Christine has surprised her nephew Scott for his birthday and is going to take him out to his favorite restaurant, Polly’s Pancake Diner. If I wanted to tell the story after it happened, I’d use the past tense:
			</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>They waited at the red light, and Scott worried they might miss their reservation. (Past tense)</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>But what I really want to convey is how the event unfolded, showing the action as it is happening:</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>They are sitting at Scott’s favorite booth, the one with the sparkling red plastic seats.(For how long? We don’t know, but we do know they are sitting there now.)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>The waiter is standing behind the counter right now with a notepad in his hand and pencil behind his ear. (Will he ever make it over to the booth? Probably, but not now.)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>“Are you waiting to open your presents after you eat your pancakes?” said Aunt Christine, taking a sip from her root beer. (Here the present continuous is being used in question form.)</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>From this narrative point of view, the action is immediate and continuous; there’s momentum. Sometimes writers use this tense to add suspense or humor in fictional pieces. What kind of pancakes will Scott and his aunt order? The suspense is killing me!</p>
			<br>
			<h3 id="vi">>📗Present Perfect Continuous Tense</h3>
			<p>
				The present perfect continuous tense (also known as the present perfect progressive tense) shows that something started in the past and is continuing at the present time. The present perfect continuous is formed using the construction has/have been + the present participle (root + -ing).
			</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>I have been reading War and Peace for a month now.
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<h3 id="vii">>📙Simple Past Tense</h3>
			<p>
				The simple past is a verb tense that is used to talk about things that happened or existed before now. Imagine someone asks what your brother Wolfgang did while he was in town last weekend.
			</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>Wolfgang entered a hula hoop contest.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>He won the silver medal.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>
				The simple past tense shows that you are talking about something that has already happened. Unlike the past continuous tense, which is used to talk about past events that happened over a period of time, the simple past tense emphasizes that the action is finished.
			</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>Wolfgang admired the way the light glinted off his silver medal.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>
				You can also use the simple past to talk about a past state of being, such as the way someone felt about something. This is often expressed with the simple past tense of the verb to be and an adjective, noun, or prepositional phrase.
			</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>Wolfgang was proud of his hula hoop victory.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>The contest was the highlight of his week.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<h3 id="viii">>📘Past Perfect Tense</h3>
			<p>The past perfect, also called the pluperfect, is a verb tense used to talk about actions that were completed before some point in the past.</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>We were shocked to discover that someone had graffitied “Tootles was here” on our front door. We were relieved that Tootles had used washable paint.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<P>
				The past perfect tense is for talking about something that happened before something else. Imagine waking up one morning and stepping outside to grab the newspaper. On your way back in, you notice a mysterious message scrawled across your front door: Tootles was here. When you’re telling this story to your friends later, how would you describe this moment? You might say something like:
			</P>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>I turned back to the house and saw that someone named Tootles had defaced my front door!</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>
				In addition to feeling indignant on your behalf, your friends will also be able to understand that Tootles graffitied the door at some point in the past before the moment this morning when you saw his handiwork, because you used the past perfect tense to describe the misdeed.
			</p>
			<h3 id="ix">>📕Past Continuous Tense</h3>
			<p>
				The past continuous tense, also known as the past progressive tense, describes ongoing actions in the past, such as I was writing my research paper all night. It uses the same construction as the present continuous tense except with the past tense of the verb to be.
			</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>While I was studying, my friends were playing. </td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<h3 id="x">>📔Past Perfect Continuous Tense</h3>
			<p>
				The past perfect continuous tense (also known as the past perfect progressive tense) shows that an action that started in the past continued up until another time in the past. The past perfect continuous tense is constructed using had been + the verb’s present participle (root + -ing).
			</p>
			<p>
				Unlike the present perfect continuous, which indicates an action that began in the past and continued up to the present, the past perfect continuous is a verb tense that indicates something that began in the past, continued in the past, and also ended at a defined point in the past.
			</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>He had been drinking milk out the carton when Mom walked into the kitchen.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>I had been working at the company for five years when I got the promotion.</td>
				</tr>
				
			</table>
			<p>When, for, since, and before are words that you may see used alongside the past perfect continuous tense.</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>Martha had been walking three miles a day before she broke her leg.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>Cathy had been playing the piano for 35 years when she was finally asked to do a solo with the local orchestra.</td>
				</tr>
				
			</table>
			<h3 id="xi">>📗Simple Future Tense</h3>
			<p>
				The simple future is a verb tense that’s used to talk about things that haven’t happened yet.
			</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>This year, Jen will read War and Peace.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td></td>
					<td>It will be hard, but she’s determined to do it.</td>
				</tr>
			
			</table>
			<p>Use the simple future to talk about an action or condition that will begin and end in the future.</p>
			<h3 id="xii">>📙Future Perfect Tense</h3>
			<p>
				The future perfect is a verb tense used for actions that will be completed before some other point in the future.
			</p>
			<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>The parade will have ended by the time Chester gets out of bed. At eight o’clock I will have left.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>Key words:<b> Verb, past participle, tense, preposition</b></p>
			<p>The future perfect tense is for talking about an action that will be completed between now and some point in the future. Imagine that your friend Linda asks you to take care of her 
				cat for a few days while she goes on a trip. She wants you to come over today at noon so she can show you where to find the cat food and how to mash it up in the bowl just right so that Fluffy will deign to eat it. 
				But you’re busy this afternoon, so you ask Linda if you can come at eight o’clock tonight instead.</p>

				<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
					<tr>
						<td>“No, that won’t work! At eight o’clock I will have left already,” she says</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p>
					What does the future perfect tell us here? It tells us that Linda is going to leave for her trip some time after right now, but before a certain point in the future (eight o’clock tonight). She probably shouldn’t have waited until the last minute to find a cat sitter.
				</p>
				<h3 id="xiii">>📘Future Continuous Tense</h3>
				<p>
					The future continuous tense, also known as the future progressive tense, is a verb tense that shows an ongoing action in the future. It is the future version of the present continuous tense, which uses a similar construction.
				</p>
				<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#303446">
					<tr>
						<td>Future continuous:</td>
						<td> I will be watching my shows from lunch until dinner. </td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Present continuous:</td>
						<td> I am watching my shows.  </td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p>Although the future continuous tense is often confused with the simple future tense, there are some key differences between the two. The future continuous tense is usually used with a specified period of time, whereas the simple future tense can be used with or without an exact time. </p>
				<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
				<tr>
					<td>Example:</td>
					<td>They will be promoting me to manager on Friday. </td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<h3 id="xiv">>📕Future Perfect Continuous Tense</h3>
				<p>
					The future perfect continuous, also sometimes called the future perfect progressive, is a verb tense that describes actions that will continue up until a point in the future. The future perfect continuous consists of will + have + been + the verb’s present participle (verb root + -ing).
				</p>
				<p>
					When we describe an action in the future perfect continuous tense, we are projecting ourselves forward in time and looking back at the duration of that activity. The activity will have begun sometime in the past, present, or in the future, and is expected to continue in the future.
				</p>
				<table cellspacing="10px" bgcolor="#484c61">
					<tr>
						<td>Example:</td>
						<td>In November, I will have been working at my company for three years.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Example:</td>
						<td>At five o’clock, I will have been waiting for thirty minutes.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Example:</td>
						<td>When I turn thirty, I will have been playing piano for twenty-one years.</td>
					</tr>
